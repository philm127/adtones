                </div>
                <p><span class="text-blue">problem</span> Today the telecom operators do not get a share of the advertising revenue generated by services like Google and Facebook using the operators' networks. </p>
                <p><span class="text-blue">solution</span> Adtones gives operators a new revenue stream monetizing the period waiting for call pick-up by playing an ad. This allows operators to take control of advertising across their user base, giving the operators, and their customers, a share of the advertising revenue.</p>

                    <label>Giving away personal data</label>
                </div>
                <p><span class="text-blue">problem</span> Today consumers swap their personal data for next to nothing to access services like Google and Facebook – companies who then make billions from this personal data every year.</p>
                <p>On top of giving away personal data, the consumer also must pay to connect over their broadband or mobile products.</p>
                <p><span class="text-blue">solution</span> Adtones enables consumers to sell access to the highest bidder, and keep ownership and control of their time and personal data at the same time, by acting as agent for the individual consumer.</p>
                <p>The income will partly or fully fund the monthly telephony and broadband bill.</p>

                    <label>Qualified delivery</label>
                </div>
                <p><span class="text-blue">problem</span> Measurability is hard to find in digital advertisement. Getting the right ad to the right customer is equally difficult.</p>
                <p>Advertisers struggle to get qualified ad views in traditional digital media including paying for inefficient 1 second deliveries more than proper views.</p>
                <p><span class="text-blue">solution</span> Adtones’ unique media channel and delivery methods guarantees audited delivery of each and every ad to an individual consumer.</p>
                <p>Only ads played more than 6 seconds are billed and ads are only played to customers who’ve liked that particular ad type.</p>
