                <h2>Open auction</h2>
                <p>Delivery price for an ad is based on an open auction system.</p>
                <p>The auction process selects the five highest bids associated with the time slot and caller profile, and puts the ads in the profile play list.</p>
                <p>In case the caller only makes one call in the specified period, the ad at the top of the play list is played. If 3 calls are made the top 3 ads are delivered and so on. Adtones cannot guarantee a caller will make a call over a specific period.</p>
                <p>Only ads played more than 6 seconds are considered delivered. Ads played for less than 6 seconds is not charged, the caller is not paid and the ad is kept in the playlist for the next call.</p>
